Project 3 - Coming this summer, will leverage a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi Build HAT instead of a Lego Powered Hub. Same idea as project #2, with 2 locomotives working together but it will be direct instead of Bluetooth, the HATs support connection of up to 4 Powered Up connections unlike the Hubs which support only 2. Users going this route might need to invest in a $25 Powered Up extension cable for at least one of the motors.

2025:
Started working on the PoweredUp Train remote, 88010. Created two scripts (lego_pair_88010_remote.py & lego_test_88010_remote_buttons.py) using some old code and raw data from 2 years ago, in addition to assistance from ChatGPT 4o and these repos:
